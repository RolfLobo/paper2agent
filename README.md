# Paper2Agent: Reimagining Papers As AI Agents
## Overview
`Paper2Agent` is a multi-agent AI system that automatically transforms research papers into interactive AI agents with minimal human input.

## Demos
Below, we present demos of AI agents generated by Paper2Agent, highlighting example queries and how the agents leverage tools to solve tasks.
### üß¨ AlphaGenome Agent for Genomic Data Interpretation
Example query:
```
Analyze heart gene expression data with AlphaGenome MCP to identify the causal gene
for the variant chr11:116837649:T>G, associated with Hypoalphalipoproteinemia.
```


### üó∫Ô∏è TISSUE Agent for Uncertainty-Aware Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis
Example query:
```
Calculate the 95% prediction interval for the spatial gene expression prediction of gene Acta2 using TISSUE MCP.

This is my data:
Spatial count matrix: Spatial_count.txt
Spatial locations: Locations.txt
scRNA-seq count matrix: scRNA_count.txt
```

### üß´ Scanpy Agent for Single-Cell Data Preprocessing
Example query:
```
Use Scanpy MCP to preprocess and cluster the single-cell dataset pbmc_all.h5ad.
```

## ü§ñ How to Create a Paper Agent?

To streamline usage, we recommend creating a Paper Agent by connecting a Paper MCP server to an AI coding agent, such as Claude Code or the Google Gemini CLI (available for free with a Google account).
We are also actively developing our own base agent, which will be released soon.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Using Claude Code
First, install and set up Claude Code:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude
```
After setup, link Claude Code with the Paper MCP server of interest.
For example, to create an AlphaGenome Agent, run:
```
claude mcp add \
--transport http \
alphagenome \
https://Paper2Agent-alphagenome-mcp.hf.space/mcp

claude
```
‚úÖ You will now have an **AlphaGenome Agent** ready for genomics data interpretation.
